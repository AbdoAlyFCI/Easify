# Easify

First: this Progrm was written in 3 days for Code Geist hackathon 2018 (not the best thing ) but i am proud with my team that we made that with this idea.

Second: some of open library we use all thier Â© recived for the real owner 

Third:may be in the future we back to develop this project more with our own library this time ðŸ˜Š ( or at least by myself i still put that in my mind )



thanks
