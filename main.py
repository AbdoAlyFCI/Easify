#Easify work Divide into 5 main steps
#1-voice input --->main.py 
#2-send to Google voice recognize API --->SpVoice.py
#3-Outcome String form Google API  --->main.py to FeaturesClass.py
#4-Choose the right functionality  --->FeaturesClass.py
#5-Apply it --->with FeatureClass.py on the current Application (ex:Microsoft Power Point)
#6-Start again   --->threat in GUI.py
#note it is just a prototype for test use with the ability to enhance it in the future
